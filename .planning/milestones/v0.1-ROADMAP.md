# Milestone v0.1: Foundation Preview

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-25
**Phases:** 1
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

v0.1 delivers the foundational terminal dashboard for Kata project visibility. Users can launch `kata-tui` and view their `.planning/` files as structured, navigable data with vim-style keyboard navigation.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Display

**Goal**: User can launch the TUI and see their .planning/ files as structured, navigable data.
**Depends on**: None (first phase)
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffolding, terminal wrapper, panic hook
- [x] 01-02: TEA core (State/Message/Update) and event handler
- [x] 01-03: Data models and markdown parser
- [x] 01-04: Layout and UI components (tree, detail, status bar)
- [x] 01-05: View composition, App lifecycle, integration

**Details:**

**Requirements Delivered:**
- DISP-01: User can view .planning/ files parsed into structured data
- DISP-02: User can see project hierarchy in a tree view
- DISP-03: User can view detailed content of selected item in a detail pane
- NAV-01: User can navigate using keyboard (vim-style j/k/h/l and arrow keys)
- NAV-02: User can see clear visual focus indicators on the active element
- PLAT-01: Application works on macOS
- PLAT-02: Application works on Linux

**Success Criteria Met:**
1. User can run `kata-tui` in a project directory and see PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md content
2. User can navigate between phases/milestones using j/k or arrow keys
3. User sees a highlighted border indicating which element has focus
4. User can view details of any selected item in a right-side pane
5. Application runs identically on macOS and Linux terminals

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Rust + Ratatui stack — Performance, single binary, modern TUI ecosystem
- TEA architecture pattern — Predictable state management, official ratatui recommendation
- Tokio async runtime — Required for non-blocking file watching and event handling
- Two-pane layout (Phase 1) — Simpler than three-pane; output pane not needed until command execution
- 30/70 pane split — Standard dashboard ratio
- Semantic tree hierarchy — Users care about phases/requirements, not file names
- Auto-select current phase — Focus on tree view at launch for immediate context
- Minimum terminal 60x16 — Graceful handling with friendly message

**Issues Resolved:**
- Terminal state restoration on panic (RAII + panic hook)
- Async event loop avoiding UI blocking
- Rust 1.86 compatibility with ratatui 0.28

**Issues Deferred:**
- File watcher debouncing (Phase 3)
- Interactive PTY support investigation (Phase 4 if needed)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None identified
